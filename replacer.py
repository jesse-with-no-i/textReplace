# this file will contain the class Reader and the "struct" Replacement (class with public functions)

# this class has two attributes, readString and writeString. readString contains the string that will be the input
# of our find() function when looking at the text. writeString will be what we replace the readString with in our
# output text

# Attributes:
# - Replacement [] replacements
# - string infile
# - string outfile
# - string outputString
# Methods:
# - void add_replacement(string text, string replace)
#   - takes 2 strings and creates a Replacement object with those strings and adds the Replacement object into the
#     Readerâ€™s replacements
# - void replace_text()
#   - Begins the replacement operation
